# SoftwareDevelopment2_Coursework_2-Booking_Holiday_System
This was the first major program I had to write having only short brief. There was no UML or anything else and this wasn't reuired from us either. I feel I learned a lot from this coursework and realized I am capable of writing my own programs.

This is the simple booking system allowing you to create customers which can make bookings, add guests and extras to it. It uses Design patterns and though it's simple, I gained 100% from this, which makes me very proud.
